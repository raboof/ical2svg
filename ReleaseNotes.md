  * avoiding some API's that seem to be broken in OpenJDK
  * allow grouping by either calendarname (X-WG-CALNAME) or Location
  * removed dependency on batik-dom, reducing jar size
  * allow selection and ordering of groups to show
  * represent texts as 'text' elements instead of shapes: slightly less portable, but much more elegant, searchable, flexible, easier to debug and smaller in terms of resulting file-size.
  * user-selectable font face
  * better infrastructure for command-line options, improved 'usage'
